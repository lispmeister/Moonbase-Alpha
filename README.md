# Moonbase Alpha

The prime directive has changed and we are going to develop the lunar base
first. We will need atmospheric control systems that can manage large scale
habitats. Our current systems used on the ISS are definitely not powerful
enough to get the job done. I’ve started researching the necessary technologies
a year ago but am now dedicating more time to figure out an industrial scale
solution that can be ready on time.

Let’s start with a (report)[Lunar-Life-Support-Systems-Report.md] prepared by
Claude Opus 4.6 to give us an overview of publicly available information and
then dive deeper into various topics related to atmospheric control systems.
There is also a (PDF version)[Opus-4.6-Lunar-Life-Support-Systems-Report.pdf]
of the report.
